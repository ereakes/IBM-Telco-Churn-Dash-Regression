# IBM-Telco-Churn-Dash
Dashboard visualising IBMs mock churn data, using Logistic Regression in R to understand churn predictors. Using R for custom visualisations, shapefile changes and regression. Using Power BI to display the information in dashboard format.

The dashboard will aim to answer three mock 'business questions' as below: 
1. What are the key factors most strongly associated with customer churn?
2. What customer segments have the highest churn rates, and how are these segments changing over time?
3. What are the factors most associated with Churn risk?
